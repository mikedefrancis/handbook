Use this syntax for printing variables inside of makefiles
 
$(info $$TYPE_SUFFIX is [${TYPE_SUFFIX}])
 
Yields in build output:
$TYPE_SUFFIX is [64]
 
So more generically
 
$(info $$<your text to print> [${your variable name}])
In order to print “your text to print <value of variable with supplied name>” in build output!
